### [>> DEMO <<]()

## Context

This project is part of an optional course taught at HEIG-VD during the 3rd year of the Bachelor's degree in Media Engineering. The aim was to introduce us to virtual reality by creating a VR experience using the A-Frame framework.

### My game

You're sent to the moon to hone your shooting skills in preparation for the upcoming intergalactic war with the Marsians. The training program requires you to pick up a laser pistol and hit as many targets as possible within 30 seconds. Once the countdown is over, you can try again to increase your best score.
